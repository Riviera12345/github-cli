github-cli
==========

Currently, this is just an idea, but this tool will provide comprehensive 
interaction with GitHub from the commandline via the API.

Plan
----

After finishing the unittests for github3.py_, I'll start writing the basic 
scripts for this tool. It will take over the role of issues.py_ and what I 
planned to be gist.py_.
